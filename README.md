# WS_QMI8658_Matrix

The WS_QMI8658 library is used to easily integrate the QMI8658 IMU sensor into Arduino projects. It enables precise motion and position detection with calibration support, double reset detection and hysteresis logic to avoid unstable state changes.

Functions include:

* Initialisation and configuration of the QMI8658 sensor
* Calibration and storage of calibration data in NVS
* Detection of the downward-facing side of the board
* Use of hysteresis logic to stabilise sensor data

Ideal for applications in robotics, gaming and IoT where motion and position detection play a role
